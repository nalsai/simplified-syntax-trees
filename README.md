# simplified-syntax-trees

Create simplified syntax trees to visualize sentence structure for language learners.

Simply input the sentence with spaces between each phrase.
Then you can move them and click on the word you want to connect and then click on the word you want to connect it to.
By holding Alt you can move the phrase including all phrases below it.
